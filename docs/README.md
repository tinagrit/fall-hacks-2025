# Fall Hacks 2025

For this year's Fall Hacks competition, the topic given was "Mash up Mania". Our objective was to create a program that combines two completely different topics into one project.

For our project, we decided to combine fitness and food into a single web app. Our program asks the user to enter a goal for traversal and generates a radius of food locations nearby. This encourages users to exercise for long durations while also rewarding them with food locations. 

We included streaks to encourage users to continue exercise and work on their personal health.
